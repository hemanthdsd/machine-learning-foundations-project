As the outrage went viral, the hunter became the hunted. His clinic's website was shut down, and a White House petition demanding extradition got 190,000 signatures. But the level of viral indignation also prompted some to question why the outpouring of outrage for Cecil surpassed that prompted by the killing of Sandra Bland. At the same time, we watched as Ohio prosecutor Joe Deters -- fueled by very disturbing bodycam footage of the police shooting of Samuel DuBose -- announced murder charges in the case, calling the incident ""outrageous,"" ""horrendous"" and an ""absolute tragedy.""

After nearly a decade of Colbert, it's clear that what's truly special about him isn't his amazing wit, incredible timing, or even how staggeringly funny he is; it's his heart.

Meanwhile, several members of Congress walked out of the now-traditional post-massacre moment of silence, with Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) calling them ""an abomination"" that does not ""honor the victims"" but ""mocks them."" Senate Democrats then took over the Senate for 15 hours demanding action on gun control.
